An API for the Solita Dev Academy 2021 exercise.

The backend is in the directory back, and it was done with Node.js.
The web application is in the directory front_2, and was implemented with React, whereas the API was made with Python 3.8, and is in the directory front.

## Instructions
To use the API, start the backend and either one of the frontends.

* Start the API: `python hello.py`. Use `-h` to look for help with the arguments.
